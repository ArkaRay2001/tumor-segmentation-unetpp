# ðŸ§  Brain Tumor Segmentation with UNet++ and CBAM

A PyTorch-based medical imaging project using a custom UNet++ model enhanced with CBAM (Convolutional Block Attention Module) and deep supervision. Designed for precise segmentation of brain tumor sub-regions: **enhancing tumor (ET)**, **edema (ED)**, and **necrotic core (NCR)**.

## ðŸš€ Key Features

- **UNet++ Architecture**: Nested skip connections for better semantic learning
- **Attention Module**: CBAM (Channel + Spatial) to highlight important features
- **Deep Supervision**: Multi-scale outputs for improved gradient flow and convergence
- **Hybrid Loss Function**: Combines Focal Loss, Dice Loss, and BCE to handle class imbalance
- **Medical-Specific Augmentations**: Rician noise, bias field simulation, intensity perturbations
- **Optimized Training**: Mixed-precision (AMP), gradient clipping, and OneCycleLR scheduler
